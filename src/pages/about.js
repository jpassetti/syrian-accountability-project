			<Paragraph>Now in its fifth phase, the project aims to produce non-partisan, high quality analysis of open source materials and to catalogue that information relative to applicable bodies of law; including, the Geneva Conventions, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, and Syrian Penal Law.</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>The SAP primarily creates documentation products in a narrative and graphical format, as well as a quarterly and annual trend analysis of ongoing crimes. Furthermore, the SAP publishes issue-specific white papers. Its clients include the Syrian National Council, United Nations, U.S. Department of State, and the International Criminal Court.</Paragraph>
